 ## Employee Feedback System â€“ FastAPI Project

Hi! I'm B. Yogeswari, and this is a simple **Employee Feedback System** I built using **FastAPI**. The goal of this project is to allow managers to give feedback to employees based on their performance.

Itâ€™s designed to be simple, fast, and easy to use â€“ perfect for learning and demo purposes!

## What You Can Do with This App

1. Sign up and log in as a user (either a manager or employee)  
2. Managers can submit feedback like strengths, areas to improve, and overall sentiment  
3. View all feedbacks in a structured format  
4. All data is stored safely in a local database using SQLAlchemy and SQLite  

## Tech I Used

- **FastAPI** â€“ backend framework  
- **SQLite** â€“ lightweight local database  
- **SQLAlchemy** â€“ ORM to interact with the database  
- **Uvicorn** â€“ to run the FastAPI server  
- **Pydantic** â€“ for data validation and schema management

## A Note from Me
This project helped me understand backend development, routing, and working with databases.
Iâ€™m continuing to improve it and hope itâ€™s useful as a learning demo!
